By browsing the public areas or by accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of: (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, and (iii) the terms of use and privacy policies of our “Partner Companies” (as defined in our Privacy Policy), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference (collectively, this “Agreement.”).

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>1.  DESCRIPTION AND USE OF SERVICES</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>72Lux is focused on simplifying e-commerce both on 72Lux.com and on other publisher’s websites. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We believe that you deserve an online shopping experience that delivers what you want through effortless clicks.  We believe that women have never been more busy, and are taking on more roles than ever before.  72Lux offers you a new solution to shop for the best products in a customer-centric shopping experience. Whether you are a full-time professional, parent, philanthropist, or all three, we know how busy you are, so our goal is to make online shopping an exciting, yet effortless experience for you. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>72Lux is working with the best designers and best retailers to allow you to shop them all in one place and with a universal checkout.  We have easy-to-use search tools, which will help you easily find what you’re looking for. By using 72Lux, you can easily shop products you see featured.  Once you’re ready to purchase, you’ll only have to go through one check-out process, even if you’re purchasing from multiple retailers.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We would like to point out, however, that although you are able to find information about and purchase these amazing products through the Services, we are not the merchant of record (the applicable retailers are), nor are we a party to any transaction you make with these retailers.  Accordingly, we shall have no liability to any party in connection with such transactions.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We provide Visitors and Registered Users with access to the Services as described in this Agreement.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Visitors.  Visitors, as the term implies, are people who don’t register with us, but want to browse our virtual storefront.  No login is required for Visitors.  Visitors can (a) browse for the best clothes and accessories; (b) view all publicly-accessible content, and (c) e-mail us.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Registered Users.  Login is required for all Registered User services.  Registered Users can do all the things that Visitors can do, and can: (a) purchase the products and services offered through the Services; (b) shop with our personal shopper tool to customize your shopping experience; (c) participate in our exclusive promotional offers and sweepstakes, (d) sign up for alerts and other notifications, and (e) post comments.  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We are under no obligation to accept any individual as a Registered User, and may accept or reject any registration in our sole and complete discretion.  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Also, when using the Services via our Mobile Apps, Registered Users may elect to consent to the use of their Mobile Device’s Geolocational Information to provide the Services. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>2.  COMMUNITY GUIDELINES</h3>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to deny you access to the Services, or any portion of the Services, without notice, and to remove any comments that do not adhere to these guidelines.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>3.  RESTRICTIONS</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Services are available for individuals aged 13 years or older.  If you are 13 or older, but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it.  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>4.  PAYMENT</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You agree that 72Lux may immediately authorize your credit card (or other approved facility) for payment for all purchases made under your Password (as defined below).   </p>
          <p>As set forth more fully in Section 5 below, you must keep your Password strictly confidential.

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>During the registration process for Registered Users, we will ask you to create an account, which includes a sign-in name (“Sign-In Name”), a password (“Password”), and perhaps certain additional information that will assist in authenticating your identity when you log-in in the future (“Unique Identifiers”).  When creating your account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information.  Each Sign-In Name and corresponding Password can be used by only one Registered User.  You are solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of your Sign-In Name, Password, and Unique Identifiers, as well as for any use, misuse, or communications entered through the Services using one or more of them.  You will promptly inform us of any need to deactivate a Password or Sign-In Name, or change any Unique Identifier.  We reserve the right to delete or change your Password, Sign-In Name, or Unique Identifier at any time and for any reason.  72Lux will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>6.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Services contains material, such as software, text, graphics, images, sound recordings, audiovisual works, and other material provided by or on behalf of 72Lux (collectively referred to as the “Content”).  The Content may be owned by us or by third parties.  The Content is protected under both United States and foreign laws.  Unauthorized use of the Content may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws.  You have no rights in or to the Content, and you will not use the Content except as permitted under this Agreement.  No other use is permitted without prior written consent from us.  You must retain all copyright and other proprietary notices contained in the original Content on any copy you make of the Content.  You may not sell, transfer, assign, license, sublicense, or modify the Content or reproduce, display, publicly perform, make a derivative version of, distribute, or otherwise use the Content in any way for any public or commercial purpose.  The use or posting of the Content on any other website or in a networked computer environment for any purpose is expressly prohibited. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>If you violate any part of this Agreement, your permission to access and/or use the Content and the Services automatically terminates, and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of the Content.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The trademarks, service marks, and logos of 72Lux (“72Lux Trademarks”) used and displayed on the Services are registered and unregistered trademarks or service marks of 72Lux.  Other company, product, and service names located on the Services may be trademarks or service marks owned by others (the “Third-Party Trademarks”, and, collectively with 72Lux Trademarks, the “Trademarks”).  Nothing on the Services should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use the Trademarks, without our prior written permission specific for each such use.  Use of the Trademarks as part of a link to or from any site is prohibited unless establishment of such a link is approved in advance by us in writing.  All goodwill generated from the use of 72Lux Trademarks inures to our benefit. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Elements of the Services are protected by trade dress, trademark, unfair competition, and other state and federal laws and may not be copied or imitated, in whole or in part, by any means, including but not limited to the use of framing or mirrors.  None of the Content may be retransmitted without our express, written consent for each and every instance.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>7.  COMMUNICATIONS TO US; USER SUBMISSIONS; AND PUBLICITY</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Although we encourage you to e-mail us, we do not want you to, and you should not, e-mail us any content that contains confidential information.  With respect to all e-mails you send to us, including but not limited to, feedback, questions, comments, suggestions, and the like, we shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in your communications for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, the development, production and marketing of products and services that incorporate such information.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You retain all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in and to anything you post to the Services, including text and photographs.  You do, however, grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, modify, copy, distribute, publish, perform, sublicense, and create derivative works from all submissions you provide to us in any media now known or hereafter devised and for any purpose, and the right, but not the obligation, to use any such material, including, without limitation, your name, image, likeness, photograph, and Sign-In Name to advertise and promote the Services and/or 72Lux.    </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>THE CONTENT AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>72LUX HAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO DISPLAY THE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, COLORS, AND IMPRINTS AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE ON THE SERVICES.  HOWEVER, THE FINAL PRODUCT AND/OR SERVICE DELIVERED MAY VARY FROM THE IMAGES VIEWED ON THE SERVICES DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL.  THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SYSTEM CAPABILITIES AND CONSTRAINTS OF YOUR COMPUTER, MANUFACTURING PROCESS ISSUES, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCT AND RAW MATERIALS.  ALTHOUGH 72LUX WILL EXERCISE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONFORM TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS, VARIATIONS SOMETIMES OCCUR.  ALL PRODUCT AND SERVICE PRICING, SPECIFICATIONS, AND OFFERINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. THE SERVICES MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF PARTICIPATING RETAILERS AND PARTNER COMPANIES, NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN EVERY LOCATION.  A REFERENCE TO A PRODUCT OR SERVICE ON THE SERVICES DOES NOT IMPLY THAT SUCH PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS OR WILL BE AVAILABLE IN YOUR LOCATION.  THE SERVICES MAY CONTAIN TECHNICAL INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR OMISSIONS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUCH TYPOGRAPHICAL, TECHNICAL, OR PRICING ERRORS LISTED ON THE SERVICES.    </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>9.  EXTERNAL SITES</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites (“External Sites”).  These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us of the content on such External Sites.

In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>11. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
