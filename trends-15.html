      <h3><strong>Hot</strong>HANDBAGS</h3>
      <small class="img"><img src="images/fullshot.png" width="229" /></small>
      <p>Handbags are the most desirable fashion accessory for women from every age group and every class. Apart from carrying personal items, it is a complimenting add-on, which gives a stylish look to your personality. They come in variety of designs, sizes and shapes. On different occasions, handbags play an important role in your look. Handling the wrong kind of bag on a meticulous occasion may distort your appearance and shift the fashion statement that you were aiming for. An "It-Bag" is a designer handbag that is deemed the "must-have" item of the moment as a result of a combination of many things.  These things include cunning marketing techniques to prominent celebrity usage, their overall distinguished quality and furthermore, ability to represent the season. They are generally produced in limited edition quantities and then in some instances, replicated by other designers and retailers.</p>
      <p>In the long run, handbags are arguably more essential than other “investment pieces” (like sunglasses) and require even more careful consideration upon choosing the right one. Unless you can afford to buy a new “it” bag every season, you want one that will withstand the passing of trends and continue to be a necessity in your wardrobe for years to come. It’s very important that you really, really love the bag you are purchasing and aren’t just buying it for status.</p>

      <p>Also keep price in mind.  Do not purchase a handbag just because it’s marked down because that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the bag for you.  If you’re going to spend a lot of money regardless, pay full price for something you’ll love for a long time.  As in any circumstance, a timeless piece speaks for itself; you can wear it for all time without it becoming outdated. At the very least, bags redefine the idea of your basic summer tote or your dire winter must-have. If purchasing correctly, you will have a handbag to last you through all the seasons.  To be frank, I’d be utterly surprised if you didn’t get looks of jealousy shooting your way from now until end of time if you purchase correctly and always keep class in mind.   We have combed through all of this seasons bags and have curated our top picks that we deem worthy for your classic wardrobe.  Click “get it now” for more details and to shop the look.</p>
